This is an attempt at refactoring my earlier calculator build, with a focus on:
    Clean code, 
    Modularity, 
    Commenting, 
    and implementing keyboard functionality once the refactoring is complete.

1. Project setup - carried across the very basic pre-existing code which was already arranged nicely. 
2. Removed duplicated step when handling 'backspace' event.
